# Reinforcement-Learning-Pair-Trading
## Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach to statistical arbitrage by implementing a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning algorithm on top of traditional rule-based pair trading strategy. Through the application of deep reinforcement learning techniques, we demonstrate how DQN can learn optimal trading decisions by considering both traditional statistical measures and dynamic market conditions. Our empirical results show that this approach achieves superior performance compared to conventional threshold-based methodologies, particularly in its ability to adapt to changing market conditions and manage risk effectively.
## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Background
Statistical arbitrage has long been a cornerstone strategy in quantitative trading, with pair trading representing one of its most well-known implementations. Traditional pair trading approaches rely on predetermined statistical thresholds to trigger trading signals, assuming that the spread between two cointegrated securities will maintain historical patterns. However, these conventional methods often fail to adapt to evolving market dynamics and may miss opportunities or incur losses when historical relationships temporarily break down.
Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution to this limitation by learning optimal trading policies through direct interaction with the market environment. Unlike traditional methods, RL agents can generalize patterns and recognize subtle shifts in market regimes that might not be captured by simple statistical thresholds. Furthermore, RL's ability to optimize for long-term rewards rather than immediate profits allows it to develop more sophisticated trading strategies that balance risk and return across different market conditions. The adaptive nature of RL makes it particularly well-suited for pair trading, where the relationship between securities can evolve over time and traditional static rules may become suboptimal.

### 1.2 Research Objectives
This research introduces a novel framework that leverages deep Q-learning to overcome the limitations of traditional pair trading approaches. By implementing a Deep Q-Network architecture, we aim to develop a trading system that can dynamically adjust its strategy based on market conditions while maintaining the fundamental principles of statistical arbitrage. Our approach moves beyond simple threshold-based rules to incorporate a broader range of market indicators and position management considerations.
